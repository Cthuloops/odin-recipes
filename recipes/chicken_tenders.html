        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Marinade</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs. chicken tenderloins</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Breading</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper(optional)</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground plack pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>3 tbsp buttermilk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Enough vegetable oil to fill your deep fryer</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Marinade</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine buttermilk and seasonings (I usually do so inside the 
                measuring cup for the buttermilk</li>
            <li>Add chicken tenders to a gallon size sealable bag</li>
            <li>Pour the buttermilk mixture in and seal the bag (leave as 
                little air inside as possible)</li>
            <li>Massage the bag until the chicken is evenly coated</li>
            <li>Store in the fridge for at least 4 hours, although, marinading 
                 for at least 24 hours is preferable</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Breading</h3>
        <h4>Make the breading</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine all dry ingredients</li>
            <li>Whisk together until well blended</li>
            <li>Add buttermilk and stir with a fork until mixture is evenly 
                clumpy</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Bread the chicken</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove a tender from the bag and place it in the breading bowl</li>
            <li>Cover the tender completely with the breading</li>
            <li>Place aside for frying (I generally use a plate to stack them 
                on)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a backing sheet with a few layers of paper towels and set 
                 near the deep fryer</li>
            <li>Pour oil in your deep fryer until it reaches at least the min 
                line</li>
            <li>Heat the oil to 350Â° F</li>
            <li>Place an amount of tenders in the fry basket, try to avoid 
                 placing so many that they touch</li>
            <li>Fry until the tenders are floating and have a nice golden color</li>
            <li>Remove tenders from the basket and place on the lined baking 
                sheet</li>
            <li>Continue frying in batches until you cook all the tenders</li>
        </ol>
